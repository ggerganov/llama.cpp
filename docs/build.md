# Build llama.cpp locally

**To get the Code:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp
cd llama.cpp
```

The following sections describe how to build with different backends and options.

## CPU Build

Build llama.cpp using `CMake`:

```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build --config Release
```

**Notes**:

- For faster compilation, add the `-j` argument to run multiple jobs in parallel, or use a generator that does this automatically such as Ninja. For example, `cmake --build build --config Release -j 8` will run 8 jobs in parallel.
- For faster repeated compilation, install [ccache](https://ccache.dev/)
- For debug builds, there are two cases:

    1. Single-config generators (e.g. default = `Unix Makefiles`; note that they just ignore the `--config` flag):

       ```bash
       cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
       cmake --build build
       ```

    2. Multi-config generators (`-G` param set to Visual Studio, XCode...):

       ```bash
       cmake -B build -G "Xcode"
       cmake --build build --config Debug
       ```

    For more details and a list of supported generators, see the [CMake documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-generators.7.html).
- For static builds, add `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF`:
  ```
  cmake -B build -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF
  cmake --build build --config Release
  ```

- Building for Windows (x86, x64 and arm64) with MSVC or clang as compilers:
    - Install Visual Studio 2022, e.g. via the [Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/). In the installer, select at least the following options (this also automatically installs the required additional tools like CMake,...):
    - Tab Workload: Desktop-development with C++
    - Tab Components (select quickly via search): C++-_CMake_ Tools for Windows, _Git_ for Windows, C++-_Clang_ Compiler for Windows, MS-Build Support for LLVM-Toolset (clang)
    - Please remember to always use a Developer Command Prompt / PowerShell for VS2022 for git, build, test
    - For Windows on ARM (arm64, WoA) build with:
    ```bash
    cmake --preset arm64-windows-llvm-release -D GGML_OPENMP=OFF
    cmake --build build-arm64-windows-llvm-release
    ```
    Building for arm64 can also be done with the MSVC compiler with the build-arm64-windows-MSVC preset, or the standard CMake build instructions. However, note that the MSVC compiler does not support inline ARM assembly code, used e.g. for the accelerated Q4_0_N_M CPU kernels.

    For building with ninja generator and clang compiler as default:
      -set path:set LIB=C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Lib\10.0.22621.0\um\x64;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Community\VC\Tools\MSVC\14.41.34120\lib\x64\uwp;C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Lib\10.0.22621.0\ucrt\x64
      ```bash
      cmake --preset x64-windows-llvm-release
      cmake --build build-x64-windows-llvm-release
      ```

## BLAS Build

Building the program with BLAS support may lead to some performance improvements in prompt processing using batch sizes higher than 32 (the default is 512). Using BLAS doesn't affect the generation performance. There are currently several different BLAS implementations available for build and use:

### Accelerate Framework

This is only available on Mac PCs and it's enabled by default. You can just build using the normal instructions.

### OpenBLAS

This provides BLAS acceleration using only the CPU. Make sure to have OpenBLAS installed on your machine.

- Using `CMake` on Linux:

    ```bash
    cmake -B build -DGGML_BLAS=ON -DGGML_BLAS_VENDOR=OpenBLAS
    cmake --build build --config Release
    ```

### BLIS

Check [BLIS.md](./backend/BLIS.md) for more information.

### Intel oneMKL

Building through oneAPI compilers will make avx_vnni instruction set available for intel processors that do not support avx512 and avx512_vnni. Please note that this build config **does not support Intel GPU**. For Intel GPU support, please refer to [llama.cpp for SYCL](./backend/SYCL.md).

- Using manual oneAPI installation:
  By default, `GGML_BLAS_VENDOR` is set to `Generic`, so if you already sourced intel environment script and assign `-DGGML_BLAS=ON` in cmake, the mkl version of Blas will automatically been selected. Otherwise please install oneAPI and follow the below steps:
    ```bash
    source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh # You can skip this step if  in oneapi-basekit docker image, only required for manual installation
    cmake -B build -DGGML_BLAS=ON -DGGML_BLAS_VENDOR=Intel10_64lp -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=icx -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=icpx -DGGML_NATIVE=ON
    cmake --build build --config Release
    ```

- Using oneAPI docker image:
  If you do not want to source the environment vars and install oneAPI manually, you can also build the code using intel docker container: [oneAPI-basekit](https://hub.docker.com/r/intel/oneapi-basekit). Then, you can use the commands given above.

Check [Optimizing and Running LLaMA2 on IntelÂ® CPU](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/content-details/791610/optimizing-and-running-llama2-on-intel-cpu.html) for more information.

### Other BLAS libraries

Any other BLAS library can be used by setting the `GGML_BLAS_VENDOR` option. See the [CMake documentation](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/module/FindBLAS.html#blas-lapack-vendors) for a list of supported vendors.

## Metal Build

On MacOS, Metal is enabled by default. Using Metal makes the computation run on the GPU.
To disable the Metal build at compile time use the `-DGGML_METAL=OFF` cmake option.

When built with Metal support, you can explicitly disable GPU inference with the `--n-gpu-layers 0` command-line argument.

## SYCL

SYCL is a higher-level programming model to improve programming productivity on various hardware accelerators.

llama.cpp based on SYCL is used to **support Intel GPU** (Data Center Max series, Flex series, Arc series, Built-in GPU and iGPU).

For detailed info, please refer to [llama.cpp for SYCL](./backend/SYCL.md).

## CUDA

This provides GPU acceleration using an NVIDIA GPU. Make sure to have the [CUDA toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) installed.

#### Download directly from NVIDIA
You may find the official downloads here: [NVIDIA developer site](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).


#### Compile and run inside a Fedora Toolbox Container
We also have a [guide](./cuda-fedora.md) for setting up CUDA toolkit in a Fedora [toolbox container](https://containertoolbx.org/).

**Recommended for:**

- ***Particularly*** *convenient* for users of [Atomic Desktops for Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/); such as: [Silverblue](https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/silverblue/) and [Kinoite](https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/kinoite/).
- Toolbox is installed by default: [Fedora Workstation](https://fedoraproject.org/workstation/) or [Fedora KDE Plasma Desktop](https://fedoraproject.org/spins/kde).
- *Optionally* toolbox packages are available: [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/), [Red Hat Enterprise Linux >= 8.5](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux), or [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/download)


### Compilation
```bash
cmake -B build -DGGML_CUDA=ON
cmake --build build --config Release
```

### Override Compute Capability Specifications

If `nvcc` cannot detect your gpu, you may get compile-warnings such as:
 ```text
nvcc warning : Cannot find valid GPU for '-arch=native', default arch is used
```

To override the `native` GPU detection:

#### 1. Take note of the `Compute Capability` of your NVIDIA devices: ["CUDA: Your GPU Compute > Capability"](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus).

```text
GeForce RTX 4090      8.9
GeForce RTX 3080 Ti   8.6
GeForce RTX 3070      8.6
```

#### 2. Manually list each varying `Compute Capability` in the `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` list.

```bash
cmake -B build -DGGML_CUDA=ON -DCMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES="86;89"
```

### Runtime CUDA environmental variables

You may set the [cuda environmental variables](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#env-vars) at runtime.

```bash
# Use `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` to hide the first compute device.
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="-0" ./build/bin/llama-server --model /srv/models/llama.gguf
```

### Unified Memory

The environment variable `GGML_CUDA_ENABLE_UNIFIED_MEMORY=1` can be used to enable unified memory in Linux. This allows swapping to system RAM instead of crashing when the GPU VRAM is exhausted. In Windows this setting is available in the NVIDIA control panel as `System Memory Fallback`.

### Performance Tuning

The following compilation options are also available to tweak performance:

| Option                        | Legal values           | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|-------------------------------|------------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GGML_CUDA_FORCE_MMQ           | Boolean                | false   | Force the use of custom matrix multiplication kernels for quantized models instead of FP16 cuBLAS even if there is no int8 tensor core implementation available (affects V100, RDNA3). MMQ kernels are enabled by default on GPUs with int8 tensor core support. With MMQ force enabled, speed for large batch sizes will be worse but VRAM consumption will be lower.                       |
| GGML_CUDA_FORCE_CUBLAS        | Boolean                | false   | Force the use of FP16 cuBLAS instead of custom matrix multiplication kernels for quantized models                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| GGML_CUDA_F16                 | Boolean                | false   | If enabled, use half-precision floating point arithmetic for the CUDA dequantization + mul mat vec kernels and for the q4_1 and q5_1 matrix matrix multiplication kernels. Can improve performance on relatively recent GPUs.                                                           |
| GGML_CUDA_PEER_MAX_BATCH_SIZE | Positive integer       | 128     | Maximum batch size for which to enable peer access between multiple GPUs. Peer access requires either Linux or NVLink. When using NVLink enabling peer access for larger batch sizes is potentially beneficial.                                                                         |
| GGML_CUDA_FA_ALL_QUANTS       | Boolean                | false   | Compile support for all KV cache quantization type (combinations) for the FlashAttention CUDA kernels. More fine-grained control over KV cache size but compilation takes much longer.                                                                                                  |

## MUSA

This provides GPU acceleration using the MUSA cores of your Moore Threads MTT GPU. Make sure to have the MUSA SDK installed. You can download it from here: [MUSA SDK](https://developer.mthreads.com/sdk/download/musa).

- Using `CMake`:

  ```bash
  cmake -B build -DGGML_MUSA=ON
  cmake --build build --config Release
  ```

  For static build:

  ```bash
  cmake -B build -DGGML_MUSA=ON \
    -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON
  cmake --build build --config Release
  ```

The environment variable [`MUSA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`](https://docs.mthreads.com/musa-sdk/musa-sdk-doc-online/programming_guide/Z%E9%99%84%E5%BD%95/) can be used to specify which GPU(s) will be used.

The environment variable `GGML_CUDA_ENABLE_UNIFIED_MEMORY=1` can be used to enable unified memory in Linux. This allows swapping to system RAM instead of crashing when the GPU VRAM is exhausted.

Most of the compilation options available for CUDA should also be available for MUSA, though they haven't been thoroughly tested yet.

## HIP

This provides GPU acceleration on HIP-supported AMD GPUs.
Make sure to have ROCm installed.
You can download it from your Linux distro's package manager or from here: [ROCm Quick Start (Linux)](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/tutorial/quick-start.html#rocm-install-quick).

- Using `CMake` for Linux (assuming a gfx1030-compatible AMD GPU):
  ```bash
  HIPCXX="$(hipconfig -l)/clang" HIP_PATH="$(hipconfig -R)" \
      cmake -S . -B build -DGGML_HIP=ON -DAMDGPU_TARGETS=gfx1030 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      && cmake --build build --config Release -- -j 16
  ```
  On Linux it is also possible to use unified memory architecture (UMA) to share main memory between the CPU and integrated GPU by setting `-DGGML_HIP_UMA=ON`.
  However, this hurts performance for non-integrated GPUs (but enables working with integrated GPUs).

  Note that if you get the following error:
  ```
  clang: error: cannot find ROCm device library; provide its path via '--rocm-path' or '--rocm-device-lib-path', or pass '-nogpulib' to build without ROCm device library
  ```
  Try searching for a directory under `HIP_PATH` that contains the file
  `oclc_abi_version_400.bc`. Then, add the following to the start of the
  command: `HIP_DEVICE_LIB_PATH=<directory-you-just-found>`, so something
  like:
  ```bash
  HIPCXX="$(hipconfig -l)/clang" HIP_PATH="$(hipconfig -p)" \
  HIP_DEVICE_LIB_PATH=<directory-you-just-found> \
      cmake -S . -B build -DGGML_HIP=ON -DAMDGPU_TARGETS=gfx1030 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
      && cmake --build build -- -j 16
  ```

- Using `CMake` for Windows (using x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS, and assuming a gfx1100-compatible AMD GPU):
  ```bash
  set PATH=%HIP_PATH%\bin;%PATH%
  cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DAMDGPU_TARGETS=gfx1100 -DGGML_HIP=ON -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  cmake --build build
  ```
  Make sure that `AMDGPU_TARGETS` is set to the GPU arch you want to compile for. The above example uses `gfx1100` that corresponds to Radeon RX 7900XTX/XT/GRE. You can find a list of targets [here](https://llvm.org/docs/AMDGPUUsage.html#processors)
  Find your gpu version string by matching the most significant version information from `rocminfo | grep gfx | head -1 | awk '{print $2}'` with the list of processors, e.g. `gfx1035` maps to `gfx1030`.


The environment variable [`HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES`](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/understand/gpu_isolation.html#hip-visible-devices) can be used to specify which GPU(s) will be used.
If your GPU is not officially supported you can use the environment variable [`HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION`] set to a similar GPU, for example 10.3.0 on RDNA2 (e.g. gfx1030, gfx1031, or gfx1035) or 11.0.0 on RDNA3.

## Vulkan

**Windows**

### w64devkit

Download and extract [`w64devkit`](https://github.com/skeeto/w64devkit/releases).

Download and install the [`Vulkan SDK`](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#windows) with the default settings.

Launch `w64devkit.exe` and run the following commands to copy Vulkan dependencies:
```sh
SDK_VERSION=1.3.283.0
cp /VulkanSDK/$SDK_VERSION/Bin/glslc.exe $W64DEVKIT_HOME/bin/
cp /VulkanSDK/$SDK_VERSION/Lib/vulkan-1.lib $W64DEVKIT_HOME/x86_64-w64-mingw32/lib/
cp -r /VulkanSDK/$SDK_VERSION/Include/* $W64DEVKIT_HOME/x86_64-w64-mingw32/include/
cat > $W64DEVKIT_HOME/x86_64-w64-mingw32/lib/pkgconfig/vulkan.pc <<EOF
Name: Vulkan-Loader
Description: Vulkan Loader
Version: $SDK_VERSION
Libs: -lvulkan-1
EOF

```

Switch into the `llama.cpp` directory and build using CMake.
```sh
cmake -B build -DGGML_VULKAN=ON
cmake --build build --config Release
```

### Git Bash MINGW64

Download and install [`Git-SCM`](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win) with the default settings

Download and install [`Visual Studio Community Edition`](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) and make sure you select `C++`

Download and install [`CMake`](https://cmake.org/download/) with the default settings

Download and install the [`Vulkan SDK`](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home#windows) with the default settings.

Go into your `llama.cpp` directory and right click, select `Open Git Bash Here` and then run the following commands

```
cmake -B build -DGGML_VULKAN=ON
cmake --build build --config Release
```

Now you can load the model in conversation mode using `Vulkan`

```sh
build/bin/Release/llama-cli -m "[PATH TO MODEL]" -ngl 100 -c 16384 -t 10 -n -2 -cnv
```

### MSYS2
Install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) and then run the following commands in a UCRT terminal to install dependencies.
```sh
pacman -S git \
    mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gcc \
    mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-cmake \
    mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-vulkan-devel \
    mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-shaderc
```

Switch into the `llama.cpp` directory and build using CMake.
```sh
cmake -B build -DGGML_VULKAN=ON
cmake --build build --config Release
```

**With docker**:

You don't need to install Vulkan SDK. It will be installed inside the container.

```sh
# Build the image
docker build -t llama-cpp-vulkan --target light -f .devops/vulkan.Dockerfile .

# Then, use it:
docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd):/app:Z" --device /dev/dri/renderD128:/dev/dri/renderD128 --device /dev/dri/card1:/dev/dri/card1 llama-cpp-vulkan -m "/app/models/YOUR_MODEL_FILE" -p "Building a website can be done in 10 simple steps:" -n 400 -e -ngl 33
```

**Without docker**:

Firstly, you need to make sure you have installed [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/view/latest/linux/getting_started_ubuntu.html)

For example, on Ubuntu 22.04 (jammy), use the command below:

```bash
wget -qO - https://packages.lunarg.com/lunarg-signing-key-pub.asc | apt-key add -
wget -qO /etc/apt/sources.list.d/lunarg-vulkan-jammy.list https://packages.lunarg.com/vulkan/lunarg-vulkan-jammy.list
apt update -y
apt-get install -y vulkan-sdk
# To verify the installation, use the command below:
vulkaninfo
```

Alternatively your package manager might be able to provide the appropriate libraries.
For example for Ubuntu 22.04 you can install `libvulkan-dev` instead.
For Fedora 40, you can install `vulkan-devel`, `glslc` and `glslang` packages.

Then, build llama.cpp using the cmake command below:

```bash
cmake -B build -DGGML_VULKAN=1
cmake --build build --config Release
# Test the output binary (with "-ngl 33" to offload all layers to GPU)
./bin/llama-cli -m "PATH_TO_MODEL" -p "Hi you how are you" -n 50 -e -ngl 33 -t 4

# You should see in the output, ggml_vulkan detected your GPU. For example:
# ggml_vulkan: Using Intel(R) Graphics (ADL GT2) | uma: 1 | fp16: 1 | warp size: 32
```

## CANN
This provides NPU acceleration using the AI cores of your Ascend NPU. And [CANN](https://www.hiascend.com/en/software/cann) is a hierarchical APIs to help you to quickly build AI applications and service based on Ascend NPU.

For more information about Ascend NPU in [Ascend Community](https://www.hiascend.com/en/).

Make sure to have the CANN toolkit installed. You can download it from here: [CANN Toolkit](https://www.hiascend.com/developer/download/community/result?module=cann)

Go to `llama.cpp` directory and build using CMake.
```bash
cmake -B build -DGGML_CANN=on -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release
cmake --build build --config release
```

You can test with:

```bash
./build/bin/llama-cli -m PATH_TO_MODEL -p "Building a website can be done in 10 steps:" -ngl 32
```

If the following info is output on screen, you are using `llama.cpp` with the CANN backend:
```bash
llm_load_tensors:       CANN model buffer size = 13313.00 MiB
llama_new_context_with_model:       CANN compute buffer size =  1260.81 MiB
```

For detailed info, such as model/device supports, CANN install, please refer to [llama.cpp for CANN](./backend/CANN.md).

## Notes about GPU-accelerated backends

The GPU may still be used to accelerate some parts of the computation even when using the `-ngl 0` option. You can fully disable GPU acceleration by using `--device none`.

In most cases, it is possible to build and use multiple backends at the same time. For example, you can build llama.cpp with both CUDA and Vulkan support by using the `-DGGML_CUDA=ON -DGGML_VULKAN=ON` options with CMake. At runtime, you can specify which backend devices to use with the `--device` option. To see a list of available devices, use the `--list-devices` option.

Backends can be built as dynamic libraries that can be loaded dynamically at runtime. This allows you to use the same llama.cpp binary on different machines with different GPUs. To enable this feature, use the `GGML_BACKEND_DL` option when building.
