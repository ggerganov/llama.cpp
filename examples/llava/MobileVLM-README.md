# MobileVLM

Currently this implementation supports [MobileVLM-1.7B](https://huggingface.co/mtgv/MobileVLM-1.7B) / [MobileVLM_V2-1.7B](https://huggingface.co/mtgv/MobileVLM_V2-1.7B) variants.

for more information, please go to [Meituan-AutoML/MobileVLM](https://github.com/Meituan-AutoML/MobileVLM)

The implementation is based on llava, and is compatible with llava and mobileVLM. The usage is basically same as llava.

Notice: The overall process of model inference for both **MobileVLM** and **MobileVLM_V2** models is the same, but the process of model conversion is a little different. Therefore, using **MobileVLM-1.7B** as an example, the different conversion step will be shown.

## Usage
Build with cmake or run `make llava-cli` to build it.

After building, run: `./llava-cli` to see the usage. For example:

```sh
./llava-cli -m MobileVLM-1.7B/ggml-model-q4_k.gguf \
    --mmproj MobileVLM-1.7B/mmproj-model-f16.gguf \
    --image path/to/an/image.jpg \
    -p "A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions. USER: <image>\nWho is the author of this book? Answer the question using a single word or phrase. ASSISTANT:"
```

## Model conversion

1. Clone `mobileVLM-1.7B` and `clip-vit-large-patch14-336` locally:

```sh
git clone https://huggingface.co/mtgv/MobileVLM-1.7B

git clone https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-large-patch14-336
```

2. Use `llava-surgery.py` to split the LLaVA model to LLaMA and multimodel projector constituents:

```sh
python ./examples/llava/llava-surgery.py -m path/to/MobileVLM-1.7B
```

3. Use `convert-image-encoder-to-gguf.py` with `--projector-type ldp` (for **V2** please use `--projector-type ldpv2`) to convert the LLaVA image encoder to GGUF:

```sh
python ./examples/llava/convert-image-encoder-to-gguf \
    -m path/to/clip-vit-large-patch14-336 \
    --llava-projector path/to/MobileVLM-1.7B/llava.projector \
    --output-dir path/to/MobileVLM-1.7B \
    --projector-type ldp
```

```sh
python ./examples/llava/convert-image-encoder-to-gguf \
    -m path/to/clip-vit-large-patch14-336 \
    --llava-projector path/to/MobileVLM-1.7B_V2/llava.projector \
    --output-dir path/to/MobileVLM-1.7B_V2 \
    --projector-type ldpv2
```

4. Use `convert.py` to convert the LLaMA part of LLaVA to GGUF:

```sh
python ./convert.py path/to/MobileVLM-1.7B
```

5. Use `quantize` to convert LLaMA part's DataType from `fp16` to `q4_k`
```sh
./quantize path/to/MobileVLM-1.7B/ggml-model-f16.gguf path/to/MobileVLM-1.7B/ggml-model-q4_k.gguf q4_k_s
```

Now both the LLaMA part and the image encoder is in the `MobileVLM-1.7B` directory.

 This image captures a lively scene of 20 llamas in motion on an expansive, grassy field. The llama is scattered across the landscape with some standing and others sitting down as if taking rest or observing their surroundings from different vantage points within this verdant setting.

The background offers glimpses into a picturesque town nestled amidst hills under an overcast sky, adding depth to the scene while also emphasizing that distance between these llama and human-made structures like houses or roads in which they roam freely without any barriers around them. The image is framed by text at both right angles on white backgrounds against a contrasting blue backdrop with green foliage, further drawing attention to the llamas amidst their natural habitat while also inviting viewers into this picturesque landscape within town limits of Alta Llama

 The image captures a tranquil scene in a park, where a group of approximately 20 llamas are gathered. The llamas, a mix of white and black, are standing in a line, their black and white patterns contrasting with the lush green grass of the park. The lamas are arranged in a line, suggesting a social order.

The park itself is lush and green, with trees dotting the landscape in the background. A sign reading "Llamas Tico  Ana" is also visible in the image, possibly indicating the location or the breed of the llamas. The image seems to be taken from a distance, providing a wide view of the scene and the surrounding environment.

The llamas' positions relative to each other, the sign, and the trees create a harmonious composition. The image does not contain any discernible text. The overall scene is one of peace and natural beauty, with the llamas in their natural habitat, surrounded by the vibrant colors and lush greenery of the park.

 This image captures a lively scene of a group of 14 llamas in a grassy field. The llamas, with their distinctive black and white coats, are standing and walking in a line, seemingly engaged in a social activity. One
 of them, possibly the first in the line, has its back turned, perhaps observing something in the distance.

The llama in the front of the line stands out due to its black and white coloring, which is quite unusual for llama patterns. The llama in the front also seems to be more aware of its surroundings, as it faces the camera, giving a sense of engagement with the viewer.

The image is taken from the side of the llama, providing a clear view of the llama in the front and its companions. The lameness in the llama in
 front is not visible, indicating that it might not be the main focus of the photo.

The background of the image features a grassy field, with a fence and a tree visible in the distance. The tree appears to be bare, suggesting that it might be during a time of year when most trees are dormant or have shed their leaves.
