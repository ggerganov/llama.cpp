### How to use

`retieval.cpp` has parameters of its own:
- `--context-file`: file to be embedded - state this option multiple times to embed multiple files
- `--chunk-size`: minimum size of each text chunk to be embedded
- `--chunk-separator`: STRING to divide chunks by. newline by default

`retrieval` example can be tested as follows:

```bash
make -j && ./retrieval --model ./models/bge-base-en-v1.5-f16.gguf --top-k 3 --context-file README.md --context-file License --chunk-size 100 --chunk-separator .
```

This chunks and embeds all given files and starts a loop requesting query inputs:

```
Enter query:
```

On each query input, top k chunks are shown along with file name, chunk position within file and original text:

```
Enter query: describe the mit license
batch_decode: n_tokens = 6, n_seq = 1
