# llama.cpp/examples/function-calling

This example shows how to do basic function calling using llama-cli and a python wrapper to declare and call functions.

## Options

Important options for llama-cli-function-runner.py:

-   `-m FNAME, --model FNAME`: Specify the path to the function calling model (e.g., `-m "$(huggingface-cli  download meetkai/functionary-small-v3.2-GGUF functionary-small-v3.2.Q4_0.gguf)"`).
-   `--ctx-size N`: Set the size of the prompt context. The default is 1024
-   `--special`: show special tokens and function calling details

## Example showing showing function call details

```
./examples/function-calling/llama-cli-function-runner.py  -m `huggingface-cli  download meetkai/functionary-small-v3.2-GGUF functionary-small-v3.2.Q4_0.gguf` -i --special
What is the weather in Phoenix?
Sure, I'll look that up for you. Let me just check the current weather conditions in Phoenix.>>>get_weather
{"location": "Phoenix"}<|eot_id|>
{"temperature": "30C"}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
The current weather in Phoenix is 30C.<|eot_id|>
What is 38484 + 323?
Sure, let's calculate that.>>>calculate
{"expression": "38484 + 323"}<|eot_id|>
{"result": 38807}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
The sum of 38484 and 323 is 38807.<|eot_id|>
What is 67 feet in meters?
To convert 67 feet into meters, we use the conversion factor: 1 foot is approximately 0.3048 meters. Let's calculate it.>>>calculate
{"expression": "67 * 0.3048"}<|eot_id|>
{"result": 20.4216}<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>
67 feet is approximately 20.4216 meters.<|eot_id|>
```
