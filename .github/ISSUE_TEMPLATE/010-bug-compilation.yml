        Thanks for taking the time to fill out this bug report!
        This issue template is intended for bug reports where the compilation of llama.cpp fails.
        Before opening an issue, please confirm that the compilation still fails with `-DGGML_CCACHE=OFF`.
        If the compilation succeeds with ccache disabled you should be able to permanently fix the issue
        by clearing `~/.cache/ccache` (on Linux).
