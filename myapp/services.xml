        A container cluster handles incoming requests to the application and processes those requests,
        and their results. The processing to do and the API's to expose can be provides by Vespa
        or by the application through Java components supplied as part of the application.

        See:
          - Reference: https://docs.vespa.ai/en/reference/services-container.html

    <container id="default" version="1.0">
        <!--
            <document-api> tells the container that it should accept documents for indexing. Through the
            Document REST API you can PUT new documents, UPDATE existing documents, and DELETE documents
            already in the cluster.

            Documents sent to the Document REST API will be passed through document processors on the way
            to the content cluster.

            <search> tells the container to answers queries and serve results for those queries.
